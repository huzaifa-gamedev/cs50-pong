## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the **Pong** assignment from CS50's Introduction to Game Development.

---

### What I implemented:

- ✔️ Added a basic AI to control the **right paddle**, which automatically moves to deflect the ball.
- ✔️ Preserved original paddle controls for the left paddle (W / S keys).
- ✔️ Kept the core game mechanics intact from the original skeleton code.
- ✔️ Ensured smooth gameplay using LÖVE2D framework (Lua).

This AI allows single-player mode where the computer plays against you!
